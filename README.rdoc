== DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby On Rails plugin aimed to simplify user timezone detection. It gets TZ 
information from user browser, saves it in cookie and then applies the TZ in
controller. That way you always have application TZ set up for the region user is
actually in.


=== USAGE

All you have to do is to include plugin's javascripts in your application layout.
Just drop the following somewhere in the page head section:

  <%= javascript_include_tz_detection %>

That's all. Now using some before_filter magick the plugin will have set
request's time zone to match the one received in cookies. That will be the
timezone user's browser is configured for.

== HOW TO SKIP THE TIMEZONE DETECTION:

It is sometimes necessary to skip timezone detection and setup, say you
implement a general purpose web service within your app. You can skip it in your
controller like this:

  skip_before_filter :set_client_time_zone

== INSTALL:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/cleverua/client_timezone_detection.git
